**The Red Mage: Stone of Chaos**

**Description:**

- Hello, this is one of the unfinished projects I made 2 years ago back when
  I didn't know how to code/program properly. I'll just store it here for now.
- I don't think I'll be continuing it anymore but I will be making a different
  version of it sometime in the future.
