# The Red Mage: Stone of Chaos

### Description:

- Hello, this is one of the unfinished projects I made 2 years ago back when
  I didn't know how to code/program properly. One warning though, there's quite
  a lot of terrible code here.
- I don't think I'll be continuing it anymore but I will be making a different
  version of it sometime in the future.
 - I decided to upload it here just so I can have something to look back on.
